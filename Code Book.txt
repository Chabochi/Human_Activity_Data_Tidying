DATA DICTIONARY - Human Activity Recognition Mean

Variables obtained from sensor signals.

	The 79 variables registered result from the average calculation of mean and standard 
	deviation measurements of triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer and the triaxial 
	Angular velocity from the gyroscope filtered by activity or subject. The variables registered 
	can be read on the annex 1.

Activities

	Variables were measured during 6 activities than include walking, walking upstairs, walking 
	downstairs. sitting, standing, and laying. Each activity was identified with the names Walk, 
	Walkup, Walkdown, Sit, Stand and Lay accordingly.

Subjects
	Variables were recorded among 30 subjects; each subject was identified by the word
	Subject and a subsequent number from one to thirty.
